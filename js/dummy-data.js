      "Such like any Father and Mother, we were so excited to see our little son, to hug him and give him anything he needs to be happy and safe, what we didn’t expect is to stand before him unable to provide the most important thing .. the ability to walk! Adam was born in 18/04/2015; two months earlier than his due date, couple days later, he had a bleeding in the brain resulting in cerebral palsy, as a result a special device was installed in his brain when he was only few days old, since then, a journey of medical examinations, surgeries and therapies has begun with only one purpose .. help Adam to walk! Unfortunately, all what we have done didn’t work, instead, he had Muscle spasm in the lower limbs, that prevents him from moving or walking without other’s help! We have tried everything! Physical therapy, doctors, exercises, until a surgery called “SDR” become so popular recently, this surgery is only made in St. Louis Children's Hospital in the United Stated of America, with a very expensive cost, that may reach 100,000 Dollar. We have sent all Adam’s medical tests and evaluations, and on 31/10/2019 we have received a confirmation letter from the Hospital telling us that Adam’s situation is appropriate and with the surgery in addition to intensive physical therapy sessions,  he will be finally able to walk alone! This surgery is such a glimmer of hope for us and  Adam.. a hope that can’t be achieved without your help and donation.",

      "From the mid-1970s until she retired from the Kelsey School after 44 years, Nellie poured her heart into teaching you Arabic.  In December 2019, her husband, Anwar, suffered a crippling stroke and requires continual medical care.  Paying for this care has cost the family more than $30,000, draining their savings and forcing their children to take out loans.  The family is reaching the point where they cannot pay the medical bills and does not know how it will pay for the medical debt they have taken on.  Please pray for them as they walk through this difficult time. They are in true need of immediate help.  Please share this on social media or via email with other Kelsey School Alumni that you know!  If everyone shares this with former classmates, then we can reach many generations of former students. My thought was that some of you may be in a position to bless Nellie with your  financial assistance.  I have spoken with others and am aware that some have already given.   Nellie has been overwhelmed by caring for her husband and has given me permission to launch this fund on her behalf. Umm Billy writes:  'Thank you, Mark, for alerting us to the need of this lovely family, who are really struggling. Nellie was a faithful, dedicated, teacher of the Arabic language to expatriates desiring to meet needs in the Middle East. Nellie and Anwar were close friends and we have several beautiful olive wood souvenirs crafted by Anwar when he was able. My deceased husband, George Kelsey, would endorse this need and encourage Nellie's former students to help as they are able.' My name is Mark Erickson -- I am the son of Daryl & Virginia Erickson who studied at the Kelsey School from 1975-1976 and 1981-1982.  I spent the summer of 1991 studying at the Kelsey School and am now living in Amman.  Nellie tutored me in Arabic grammar all last year as I was studying for the State Department Arabic language exam. I am organizing this campaign on behalf of Nellie.  There are some overhead costs associated with the gofundme platform, but I will transfer all funds raised to Nellie.  I am in a position to transfer the money to Nellie with no costs and will do so.  I am happy to answer any questions you might have. Please pray that God will meet the needs of this family and if you are so led, please give.  Nellie will be blessed."

      "If you have had the pleasure of knowing the Coelho family, you know that they are some of the kindest, hardest working people you will ever meet. If you don't know their story, here is a quick backstory as to why they are one of the most incredible families ever. Jonathan is the sole provider and works tirelessly to care for his wife Katie and their two kids, Braedyn and Penelope. Katie is a wonderful stay at home mom who has spent countless hours caring for Braedyn who has been diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy and their sweet baby girl, Penelope. You can find more about their journey as a family on their Facebook page, Journey for Braedyn . On March 26th, Jonathan tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted into the hospital for observation due to severe breathing issues. Initially, it was thought that he would be hospitalized just over the weekend but due to recent setbacks, he was sent up to the ICU to be sedated and put on a ventilator in hopes of stabilizing him. His CT scan from last night showed aggressive Covid-19 virus in his lungs. The doctors called it “severe”, and also mentioned Jonathan had coughed up a little bit of blood yesterday. He said Jonathan is a little young to be in the ICU but as of right now his body was responding well to the ventilator. His body is responding better than what they expected considering how bad his CT scan looked. He said Jonathan will definitely be sedated for at least 10 days but maybe 14. When asked if Jonathan was going to be ok, and he said “it’s too early”. Jonathan is the most loving, kind-hearted human being. He is the most amazing husband and father. He worships Katie and his kids. This was his WORST fear, he always spoke about how he worried something would happen to him and he wouldn’t be here for us. And his worst fear came true. If you are able to help in any way, even just a few dollars, it would mean the world to the Coelho family as they fight to pull through this. Updates will be posted as they become available.Thank you. Truly, from the bottom of our hearts."

      "Welcome to ForEva Strong, A donation page dedicated for Eva Batista, our daughter, who was born on August 11th 2019 and diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) type one on Wednesday, October 2nd, 2019. SMA is a nightmare, it is a disease that robs people of physical strength by affecting the motor nerve cells in the spinal cord, taking away the ability to walk, eat or breathe. SMA Type I specifically is the most severe, diagnosed prior to one year of age. Eva is among the youngest known cases, diagnosed at just 7 weeks old. Our baby girl Eva is an expressive, smiley, and happy baby who is loved so much by her family and friends. She came into all our lives and brought a shining light with her that follows her everywhere she goes. At 2 months of age, her life has already made ours so much more full and meaningful and we could not imagine a life without her. Some of her top favourite things are: music, having her diaper changed, and of course conversations with Mommy and Daddy. As Eva’s parents, we want her to live a long, happy and healthy life and we are ready to do whatever it takes to ensure she receives the best medical care available. As we live in Canada, we do have a treatment called Spinraza available to us which increases survival motor neuron (SMN) protein production, addressing an underlying cause of SMA. We are beyond grateful that we have this available as just a few years ago, babies with SMA did not have this hope and would likely not live to reach the age of 2. There is, however, a treatment available which goes by the name Zolgensma. It is made up of a new, working copy of a human SMN gene that is placed inside a vector. A vector’s job is to take the new, working SMN gene to the motor neuron cells in the body. When the new gene reaches its destination, it is ready to tell the motor neuron cells to start making SMN protein. Although these are all positive outcomes and would allow our beautiful baby Eva to no longer have the difficult symptoms of SMA making her life easier without difficulty walking, eating or breathing the upsetting downside of it all is that it is FDA approved only in The United States and not in Canada. This treatment has a large price tag of $2.1 million dollars! USD! That’s right, talk about putting a price tag on your child’s life. It is a devastating amount that any middle class family can never achieve. We are begging our community, family, friends and everyone willing to help donate or simply share our page as every effort and donation makes a difference and will get our daughter Eva that much closer to this life-saving medication we so desperately need. I want to already express my appreciation to everyone who is willing to help our family, we could never gather the proper words to explain the depth of heartache and sadness we are facing. This is something no child or human should ever have to experience. To help get the word out, please share this Go Fund Me on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter and get your friends and family to do the same! Myself and my family will forever be grateful for it."

      "Little Livie was born on the 26th August 2019. We have never felt a love like this. It was incredible for us to see our first child smile, laugh and babble for the first time and watch her develop her little bright, affectionate and loving personality. Livie brings such joy and happiness to our lives every day and her smile can brighten the whole room even on the rainiest Irish day. We grew concerned as Livie missed some of her development milestones. We contacted her GP and were eventually referred to Crumlin Children’s Hospital. Our world changed forever on 9th April when little Livie was diagnosed with SMA type 1. This condition affects approximately one in every 10,000 babies. It had already been such a hard time for our family with the COVID-19 lockdown. Due to hospital policy on social distancing, Karen (Livie’s mum) was alone when given the diagnosis and Keith (Livie’s dad) was alone when he heard the diagnosis over the phone. It is something that will stay with us and our family for the rest of our lives. We were left devastated and one of the hardest parts of this process is being isolated without support from our family and friends during this difficult time. SMA does not affect Livie’s cognitive ability. She remains a bright, alert and bubbly little girl, curious about everything she sees and desperate to experience life. Livie’s smile and laugh are infectious. She loves engaging with people and wants to be in the thick of every conversation around her. Normal infections and illnesses such as a chest infection can be very serious for Livie, possibly life-threatening. The current COVID-19 pandemic is so worryingly dangerous for Livie. Karen will be Livie’s full time carer as Livie needs support all day and every day. Her days and weeks are busy with medical appointments and check-ups. Livie has received her first dose of another treatment called Spinraza through a lumbar puncture in Ireland. We remain hopeful that Spinraza will prolong Livie’s life and allow Livie to gain a degree of head control and sit with extra support. We have been advised that Livie will still need respiratory and feeding intervention to survive. She is already struggling with her breathing and coughing. She needs to wear an oxygen mask every night. This is very uncomfortable for Livie and she struggles to sleep with it. It is very unlikely that Livie will ever stand or walk. We are fundraising for Zolgensma because we could never afford to pay for this treatment by ourselves. Our dream for Livie is to give her the best chance at life possible. Zolgensma is our best hope to do this. If we are unable to raise enough funds to pay for little Livie’s treatment, we will put all donations towards Livie’s care with the hope of giving her the most comfortable and happy life possible."

I used to be top of my class but I was obliged to drop out of the School of Dentistry at Aleppo University in 2012 for fear of arrest by the Syrian Government due its violent response to the peaceful protests on campus. During the war, I dedicated myself to peaceful activism against the brutal dictatorship of Bashar Al Assad, as I watched friends and family members and innocent civilians being ruthlessly killed. I taught myself English in order to better communicate with Western journalists and get our story out there. Facing a litany of death threats and constant bombardment, I was eventually forced to cross the border and settle in Turkey, where I began working as a freelance journalist. I've written for The Guardian and The Telegraph newspapers and contribute to the New Yorker and the New York Times. Recently, I was accepted at Columbia University in New York where I hope to study political science. Fortunately, I was awarded a partial scholarship from Columbia to cover half of the tuition but it is still not enough and that is why I am hoping you will make a donation to help pay for my first year of tuition. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. The education I will get at Columbia will give me the tools I need to serve my people and help my country when the time comes for it to rebuild.  For many people, war leaves them angry and bitter and full of hate. For me, life's setbacks have made me stronger and motivated me to go on until my dream comes true. "

I remember the day I discovered the word performer, and realized I've been performing my whole life. Even as a child, I watched a lot of TV, and mimicked the different characters to make my mom and aunties laugh. The voices of race car commentators, British spies, American gangsters and opera singers were all in my arsenal at age 6. I craved the feeling of enjoyment my voices would evoke in my family, and soon started dressing like these characters to get my family even more hyped. By 8, I realized people were unique and so I not only copied their voice, but their personalities and physicality. I practiced becoming nuanced characters and It wasn't long before I became a one man show, dressed in a blue suit and red tie doing impressions of Obama. I was the cousin, the adults called out when the family reunion fire was dying and I'd always bring a smile to everyone's face. In school, I was always in speech or drama clubs and have represented at the highest  secondary school level.  So even after getting 8 CSEC subjects and graduating with honors from Glenmuir High School, it came as no surprise to my mom when I told her I wanted to chase my dreams. At that moment she understood that an Architectural Degree from The University of Technology was no longer the plan, because I'll never love architecture the way I love performing. My mother said I would have to do a 6th form program as a contingency, to prove to her I was serious about performing. So whilst studying and passing 5 CAPE Level subjects, at DeCarteret College, I had to solidify my career as an actor. I joined and have been trained by The Quilt Performing Arts Company, and have done a myriad of performances where I've represented Jamaica, both regionally and internationally in several theatre and film festivals, workshops, and drama based retreats. I've also  positioned myself to do film work, namely music videos, local commercials, international short films, as well as produce my own. I recently did an official narrative based film for Bob Marley's - No Woman No Cry. Having done all that, I proved to my biggest fan, my mom, that I am serious about my passion, and subsequently applied for The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London. It being the Harvard of drama schools, I am not keen on letting the opportunity pass me by. The school chooses just over 5000 applicants to "

Al Hadaf has been a home for more than 3,000 women and children a year, and we want to continue providing a safe space for them. The funds are due on April 1st, and your support would be greatly appreciated by every person who benefits from our services. This is a private campaign, and if you are receiving the link to this fundraiser, you are considered a close friend and special person to me and to the 3,000 women and children who consider Al Hadaf to be a second home every year. Any amount you are able to give is so appreciated."

      "The Wave of Hope for the Future is a school based in the middle of the Olive Grove, the unofficial camp developed on the olive tree hills surrounding the overcrowded Refugee Camp of Moria on the Isle of Lesbos, Greece. The school was funded a year ago by Mr. Zekria Farzad, a refugee from Afghanistan that arrived in Lesbos with his wife and 5 children in February 2018. Since then the school has greatly expanded and it is now counting over 900 refugee students between the age of 6 and 50 years old. The school offers classes of English, Greek, German, French, Painting and Guitar. The school currently hosts its students inside 3 tents/classrooms, built by the refugees, and counts a team of 27 teachers."
